/*
  # Add Story Ownership and Visibility System

  1. Changes to Stories Table
    - Add `created_by` column (uuid, references auth.users)
    - Add `is_public` column (boolean, default true)
    - Add `is_user_generated` column (boolean, default false)

  2. Changes to User Profiles Table
    - Add `is_profile_public` column (boolean, default true)

  3. Security Updates
    - Update RLS policies to allow users to create their own stories
    - Update RLS policies to show only public stories to all users
    - Allow users to see all their own stories regardless of visibility

  4. Notes
    - User-generated stories start as private by default
    - Users can make their profiles public/private
    - Public stories from public profiles are visible to everyone
