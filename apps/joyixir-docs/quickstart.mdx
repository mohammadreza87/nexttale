</Frame>

## Step 2: Describe Your Game

On the home page, you'll see a prompt input. Describe the game you want to build:

<Tip>
  **Good prompts are specific.** Instead of "make a game", try "Create a snake game where the snake grows when eating apples. Use arrow keys to control. Show the score in the top right."
</Tip>

### Example Prompts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Snake Game">
    ```
    Create a classic snake game with:
    - Arrow key controls
    - Snake grows when eating food
    - Score counter in top-right
    - Game over when hitting walls or self
    - Green snake, red food, dark background
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2D Platformer">
    ```
    Build a simple 2D platformer with:
    - A character that can jump and move left/right
    - Platforms to jump on
    - Collectible coins
    - A simple level with increasing difficulty
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Memory Card Game">
    ```
    Create a memory card matching game:
    - 4x4 grid of cards
    - Flip cards to find matching pairs
    - Track moves and time
    - Show "You Win!" when all matched
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 3: Watch It Build

After you send your prompt:

1. **Environment Setup** (~30 seconds) - Installing dependencies
2. **AI Generation** (~10 seconds) - Writing your game code
3. **Live Preview** - Your game appears in the preview panel

## Step 4: Iterate

Your game might not be perfect on the first try. That's okay! Just ask for changes:

- "Make the character jump higher"
- "Add a background image"
- "The collision detection isn't working, please fix it"
- "Add a pause button"

The AI remembers your conversation and builds on previous work.

## Step 5: Export Your Game

When you're happy with your game:

1. Click **Export** in the header
2. Choose **Download ZIP** or **Deploy to Vercel**
3. Your game is ready to share!
