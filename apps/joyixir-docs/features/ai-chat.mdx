## Overview

Joyixir uses **Google Gemini 3 Pro** to understand your requests and generate code. The AI maintains context throughout your conversation, building on previous messages.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="You describe what you want">
    Type your request in natural language. Be specific about features, visuals, and behavior.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI analyzes your request">
    Gemini 3 Pro processes your prompt along with the current project context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Code is generated">
    The AI returns a JSON response with file paths and complete file contents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Files are applied">
    Joyixir writes the files to WebContainer and updates the live preview.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Good Prompts

### Be Specific

<CodeGroup>
```text Bad
Make a game
```

```text Good
Create a snake game with:
- Green snake on dark background
- Red food that appears randomly
- Arrow key controls
- Score in top-right corner
- Game over when hitting walls
```
</CodeGroup>

### Describe Visual Details

The AI can't see your screen. Describe exactly what you want:

- Colors: "blue button", "dark gray background (#1a1a1a)"
- Sizes: "large title", "32px font", "full-width container"
- Layout: "centered on screen", "sidebar on left", "header at top"

### Reference Existing Code

When asking for changes, reference what exists:

```text
The player character in Index.tsx moves too fast.
Reduce the speed from 5 to 3.
```

### Break Down Complex Features

Instead of one huge prompt, build incrementally:

1. "Create a basic game canvas with a player square"
2. "Add keyboard controls to move the player"
3. "Add obstacles that the player must avoid"
4. "Add a score counter and game over screen"

## Context Window

The AI remembers:
- Last 10 messages in conversation
- Current file contents (important files)
- Selected file (if any)
- Whether Three.js is installed

<Warning>
  Very long conversations may lose early context. If the AI seems to forget something, remind it or start a new project.
</Warning>

## Response Format

The AI returns structured JSON:

```json
{
  "message": "Created snake game with controls and scoring",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "/src/pages/Index.tsx",
      "content": "// Full file content..."
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Details about what was implemented",
  "needsThreeJs": false
}
```

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use game development terminology">
    - "game loop", "sprite", "collision detection"
    - "frame rate", "delta time", "physics"
    - "state machine", "player input"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mention the tech stack">
    - "Use Canvas API for rendering"
    - "Use React state for game state"
    - "Use requestAnimationFrame for the loop"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Provide examples">
    - "Like Flappy Bird but with..."
    - "Similar to Space Invaders where..."
    - "A match-3 game like Candy Crush"
