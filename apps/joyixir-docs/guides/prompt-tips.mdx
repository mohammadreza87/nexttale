## The Art of Prompting

Getting great results from Joyixir starts with great prompts. Here's how to communicate effectively with the AI.

## The SPEC Framework

Use this framework for comprehensive prompts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="S - Scope">
    What type of game/app? What's the main goal?
  </Step>
  <Step title="P - Player/User">
    How do they interact? Controls, inputs, flow?
  </Step>
  <Step title="E - Elements">
    What objects, characters, UI elements exist?
  </Step>
  <Step title="C - Conditions">
    Win/lose conditions, rules, constraints?
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Using SPEC

```text
Create a brick breaker game where:
- [Scope] Classic arcade-style brick breaking
- [Player] Mouse controls paddle, click to launch ball
- [Elements] Paddle at bottom, ball, 5 rows of colored bricks
- [Conditions] Win when all bricks broken, lose if ball falls 3 times
```

## Good vs Bad Prompts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Too Vague">
    ```text
    ❌ Make a game
    ❌ Create something fun
    ❌ Build an app
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Just Right">
    ```text
    ✅ Create a Tetris clone with:
       - Standard 10x20 grid
       - 7 tetromino shapes
       - Arrow keys to move/rotate
       - Score based on lines cleared
       - Increasing speed as score rises
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Too Complex">
    ```text
    ❌ Create an MMO RPG with 100 quests,
       50 character classes, multiplayer
       with 1000 concurrent users, voice
       chat, and blockchain integration
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Iteration Prompts

After initial generation, use these patterns:

### Bug Fixes
```text
The [specific thing] isn't working correctly.
When I [action], it should [expected], but instead [actual].
Please fix this in [filename].
```

### Adding Features
```text
Add [feature] to the game:
- It should [behavior]
- Triggered by [input/condition]
- Display [visual feedback]
```

### Visual Changes
```text
Change the [element]:
- Color from [current] to [new]
- Size from [current] to [new]
- Position to [location]
```

### Performance
```text
The game is running slowly. Please optimize:
- Reduce re-renders
- Use requestAnimationFrame efficiently
- Minimize state updates
```

## Magic Phrases

These phrases help the AI understand your intent:

| Phrase | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| "Keep it simple" | Avoids over-engineering |
| "Production ready" | Adds error handling, types |
| "Like [game name]" | Uses familiar patterns |
| "Mobile friendly" | Adds touch controls |
| "Accessible" | Adds ARIA labels, keyboard nav |

## Common Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Asking for too much at once">
    Break complex games into phases. Build the core loop first, then add features.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Being too abstract">
    "Make it look nice" doesn't help. Specify colors, fonts, layouts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Forgetting context">
    Reference existing files and features when asking for changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not testing incrementally">
    Test each change before adding more. It's easier to debug small changes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Template Prompts

Copy and customize these:

<CodeGroup>
```text Arcade Game
Create a [game type] game with:
- Canvas size: [width]x[height]
- Player: [description], controlled by [input]
- Enemies: [type], spawn every [interval]
- Scoring: [points] per [action]
- Game over when: [condition]
- Visual style: [description]
```

```text Puzzle Game
Build a [puzzle type] puzzle with:
- Grid: [rows]x[cols]
- Pieces: [types/colors]
- Match rule: [how to match]
- Win condition: [goal]
- Moves/time limit: [limit]
- Animations: [effects]
```

```text Interactive Tool
Create a [tool type] that:
- Input: [what user provides]
- Process: [what it does]
- Output: [what it shows]
- Persist: [what to save]
- UI style: [design notes]
```
