### Upgraded to Gemini 3 Pro Preview

We've upgraded our AI model to **Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview** for better code generation:

- **Thinking capability** - Better reasoning for complex game logic
- **Larger output** - Can generate bigger files (32K tokens)
- **Newer knowledge** - Knows latest frameworks and libraries
- **Better structured outputs** - More reliable JSON responses

### Project Persistence

Your projects now **save automatically** to the cloud:

- Files are saved immediately after AI generation
- Files persist across browser refreshes
- Restore your project from any device
- Auto-save on manual file edits

<Note>
  Projects created before this update may need to regenerate code once to enable persistence.
</Note>

### Avatar Fallback for WebContainer

Fixed an issue where Google profile pictures were blocked by WebContainer's security policy. Now shows user initials as a fallback.
