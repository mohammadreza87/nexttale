## Tips for Better Results

::: tip Be Specific
Instead of "make a game", try "create a platformer with a jumping character, 3 platforms, and coin collection"
:::

::: tip Iterate
Start simple, then add features one at a time. "Add a double jump" works better than cramming everything into one prompt.
:::

::: tip Reference Existing Games
"Like Flappy Bird but with a rocket ship" gives the AI a clear mental model.
:::

::: tip Use Device Preview
Test your game on different screen sizes using the device toggles (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).
