# Your First Game

Let's build a complete game step by step.

## What We're Building

A classic **Snake game** with:
- Moving snake
- Food collection
- Score tracking
- Game over state

## Step 1: Create the Game

Open Joyixir and type:

```
Create a snake game with a green snake on a dark background
```

Wait for the AI to generate the code. You should see a basic snake appear in the preview.

## Step 2: Add Controls

```
Add arrow key controls to move the snake
```

Now you can move the snake with your keyboard.

## Step 3: Add Food

```
Add red food that appears randomly. When the snake eats it, grow longer.
```

## Step 4: Add Score

```
Add a score counter in the top-right corner. +10 points per food.
```

## Step 5: Add Game Over

```
End the game if the snake hits the wall or itself. Show "Game Over" with final score.
```

## Final Result

You now have a complete, playable Snake game! 

## What's Next?

Try adding:
- "Add increasing speed as score goes up"
- "Add a high score that persists"
- "Add sound effects"
- "Make it mobile-friendly with touch controls"
