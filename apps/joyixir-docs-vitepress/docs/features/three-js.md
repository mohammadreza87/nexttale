# 3D Support

Build immersive 3D experiences with Three.js.

## Auto-Installation

When you describe a 3D game, Joyixir automatically installs:

- `three` - Core library
- `@react-three/fiber` - React renderer
- `@react-three/drei` - Helpers and controls

## Trigger Words

These phrases activate 3D mode:

- "3D game", "3D scene"
- "Three.js", "WebGL"
- "first-person", "third-person"
- "orbit controls"
- "3D models"

## Example Prompts

```
Create a 3D scene with a rotating cube and orbit controls
```

```
Build a first-person maze game with textured walls
```

```
Make a 3D solar system with orbiting planets
```

## Performance Tips

- Use simple geometries when possible
- Limit the number of lights
- Use `instancedMesh` for many similar objects
