# Live Preview

See your game running in real-time.

## Features

- **Instant Updates**: Changes appear in seconds
- **Hot Reload**: No page refresh needed
- **Full Screen**: Toggle fullscreen mode
- **Reload**: Force refresh the preview

## How It Works

Joyixir uses [WebContainer](https://webcontainers.io/) to run a full Node.js environment in your browser. Your code runs locally - nothing is sent to a server.

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Not Loading?

1. Check the terminal for errors
2. Make sure your code compiles
3. Try clicking the reload button

### Performance Issues?

Complex games may run slower in the preview. Export and run locally for best performance.
