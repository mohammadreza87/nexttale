# "The Creative Revolution Starts Here"

### Series A Funding Round
### January 2025

---

# Today, I want to tell you about a revolution.

---

# The world has 50 million creators.

They make games.
They write stories.
They compose music.
They design interactive experiences.

**And most of them are broke.**

---

# Here's the problem.

| Platform | Creator Cut | Minimum Payout | Barrier to Entry |
|----------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| YouTube | 55% | $100 | High (algorithm) |
| TikTok | 20-40% | $50 | Very High (saturated) |
| Spotify | $0.003/stream | $100 | Extreme (labels) |
| App Store | 70% (games) | $10 | Extreme (dev skills) |

The platforms **exploit** creators.
The algorithms **bury** creators.
The tools are **too complex** for creators.

**Creators have the talent. They don't have the power.**

---

# Until now.

---

# Introducing NextTale.

**Create. Play. Earn.**

The first AI-powered platform where anyone can create professional games, interactive stories, music, and digital experiences — and actually get paid for them.

---

# Watch this.

*[DEMO: User types "Create a puzzle game about space exploration"]*

*[In 30 seconds, a fully playable game appears]*

*[User publishes. Immediate visibility. First tip arrives in 2 minutes.]*

**That's NextTale.**

No code. No complexity. No gatekeepers.

---

# But we didn't stop there.

---

# We asked ourselves:

"What if every piece of creative work could be **owned**?"

"What if creators could earn **forever** from their work?"

"What if the **community** decided what was valuable?"

---

# So we built TaleCoin.

Our native cryptocurrency that powers the creator economy.

| Traditional Platform | NextTale |
|---------------------|----------|
| Platform owns content | **Creators own content** |
| Algorithm decides value | **Community decides value** |
| One-time payment | **Perpetual royalties** |
| Opaque revenue | **Transparent blockchain** |

---

# How TaleCoin Works

```
Creator makes content
        ↓
Community engages (views, likes, plays)
        ↓
Creator earns TaleCoin
        ↓
Creator can:
├── Cash out to USD
├── Reinvest in boosting content
├── Mint content as NFT
└── Trade on exchanges (future)
```

**Every view. Every play. Every interaction. Creators earn.**

---

# The NFT Revolution

Every piece of content on NextTale can become an NFT.

**But not just any NFT.**

| Old NFTs (JPEG) | NextTale NFTs |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Static image | Playable games |
| Look at it | Experience it |
| Speculative value | Utility value |
| No royalties | 10% perpetual royalties |

**When you own a NextTale NFT, you own a living piece of interactive art.**

---

# Let me show you how powerful this is.

*[DEMO: Creator mints a game as NFT]*

**Creator:** "I made this puzzle game. It has 50,000 plays. I'm minting 100 editions."

*[Sets price: 500 TaleCoin each]*

**Day 1:** All 100 sell. Creator earns 50,000 TaleCoin.

**Day 30:** Secondary sales begin. Creator earns 10% of every resale. **Forever.**

**This is passive income for creators.**

And we're just getting started.

---

# The Market Opportunity

---

# The Creator Economy is MASSIVE.

| Market | Size (2024) | Growth |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Creator Economy | $250 Billion | 15% CAGR |
| Gaming Industry | $190 Billion | 10% CAGR |
| NFT Market | $25 Billion | 35% CAGR |
| AI Content Creation | $15 Billion | 40% CAGR |

**Total Addressable Market: $480 Billion**

---

# But here's what no one is talking about.

**The next 1 billion creators haven't created yet.**

They have ideas.
They have stories.
They have talent.

They don't have:
- Coding skills
- Design training
- Music production knowledge
- Marketing budgets

**NextTale removes ALL of these barriers.**

---

# Who are our users?

**The Aspiring Game Designer**
"I've always wanted to make games, but I don't know how to code."

**The Writer with Stories**
"I have novels in my head but publishing is impossible."

**The Musician without a Label**
"I make beats but Spotify pays me nothing."

**The Educator**
"I want to make learning fun but tools are too complex."

---

# They're all coming to NextTale.
