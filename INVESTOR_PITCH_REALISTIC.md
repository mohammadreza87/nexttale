| 5.2 hours/week on content creation | EdWeek Survey |
| 68% say students are disengaged | Gallup |

**Teachers are overworked, underpaid, and desperate for tools that actually work.**

## A5: What We Learned from The Pivot

We originally planned a much larger vision (NFTs, cryptocurrency, creator economy). After research, we found:

- NFT market down 96% from peak
- Creator economy startups failing at record rates
- AI-generated content has copyright uncertainty

**We chose focus over fantasy.**

This makes us better founders, not worse.
