## Elevator Pitches

### 10-Second (Investor)
"We're Canva for interactive educational content. Teachers type what they want to teach, AI generates a playable game in 60 seconds."

### 30-Second (Customer)
"You know how you spend hours every week making review games and quizzes? NextTale uses AI to create them in 60 seconds. Just describe what you want to teach, and you get a playable game you can share with students immediately. It works in Google Classroom, Canvas, whatever you use."

### 2-Minute (Full)
"Teachers spend 5+ hours a week creating content, and most of it still doesn't engage students. They're burned out, and students are checked out.

We built NextTale to fix that. It's an AI-powered tool that creates interactive games, quizzes, and experiences from simple text prompts. Type 'photosynthesis quiz for 7th grade' and in 60 seconds, you have a fully playable game.

Unlike Kahoot where you write every question manually, or Nearpod where you build slides one by one, NextTale generates complete interactive content instantly. Teachers just describe what they want, and AI builds it.

We integrate with Google Classroom, Canvas, and other LMS platforms, so it works where teachers already work. And we give teachers analytics on how students performed.

We're free for basic use, $9/month for individual teachers, and we have school and district plans. We launched 3 months ago and already have 500 teachers who've created over 10,000 games.

We're raising $750K to build out LMS integrations and grow our teacher base. Want to see a demo?"
